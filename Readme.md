## Description

This mod gives you the option to disable the automatic cutting of trees.

In the game pawns automatically cut trees
- in growing zones
- under building structure blueprints
- when roofing a area

Especially with the ideology precepts of 'Tree Cutting' and 'Tree' this is very annoying, because pawns get a mood debuff from it.  

In this mod, you have six settings to disable the automatic cutting of trees:  
1. **Colonist**     
When one of your colonists gets a mood debuff from cutting trees  
-> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
2. **Slaves**       
When one of your slaves gets a mood debuff from cutting trees  
-> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
3. **Guest**        
  When one of your guest (temporary Colonist from quests) gets a mood debuff from cutting trees  
  -> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
4. **Prisoner**   
  When one of your prisoner gets a mood debuff from cutting trees  
  -> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
5. **ManualList**  
  All pawns with a mood debuff from cutting trees, get a extra Gizmo toggle button to add this Pawn to a manual list.  
  When an alive pawn with mood debuff stands on this list.  
  -> Nobody will automatically cut trees.  
6. **General**  
  -> Nobody will automatically cut trees. (when someone wants more micromanagement)  

The mod has also a quick setting function to quickly toggle the above settings.  
In the bottom right corner of your screen you have a widget button, which opens a floating menu.  
This button can be disabled in the mod settings.
