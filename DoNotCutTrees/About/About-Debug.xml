BUILDTIME: EXAMPLETIMESTAMP
This mod gives you the option to disable the automatic cutting of trees.

In the game pawns automatically cut trees
- in growing zones
- under building structure blueprints
- when roofing a area

Especially with the ideology precepts of 'Tree Cutting' and 'Tree' this is very annoying, because pawns get a mood debuff from it.

In this mod, you have four Settings to disable the automatic cutting of trees:
1. Colonist   - When one of your colonists gets a mood debuff from cutting trees, nobody will automatically cut trees.
2. Slaves     - When one of your Slaves gets a mood debuff from cutting trees, nobody will automatically cut trees.
3. Guest      - When one of your guest (temporary Colonist from quests) gets a mood debuff from cutting trees, nobody will automatically cut trees.
4. Prisoner   - When one of your prisoner gets a mood debuff from cutting trees, nobody will automatically cut trees.
5. ManualList - All pawns with a mood debuff from cutting trees, get a extra Gizmo toggle button to disable automatically cutting of trees for all pawns.
4. General    - When this setting is activated, all automatic cutting of trees is disabled (when someone wants more micromanagement)
